"""
blocks_gtn, blocks_htn, and blocks_hgn all are implementations of the
near-optimal blocks-world planning algorithm described in the following
paper:

    N. Gupta and D. S. Nau. On the complexity of blocks-world 
    planning. Artificial Intelligence 56(2-3):223â€“254, 1992.

The three implementations differ as follows: blocks_gtn uses both tasks
and goals, blocks_htn only uses tasks, and blocks_hgn only uses goals.
