# GTPyhop provides a built-in multigoal method called m_split_multigoal to
# separate a multigoal G into aÂ collection of unigoals. It returns a list of
# goals [g1, ..., gn, G], where g1, ..., gn are the unigoals in G that aren't
# true in the current state. Since G is at the end of the list, seek_plan
# will first plan for g1, ..., gn and then call m_split_multigoal again, in
# order to re-achieve any goals that (due to deleted-condition interactions)
# became false while accomplishing g1, ..., gn.

# The main problem with m_split_multigoal is that it isn't smart about
# choosing an order in which to achieve g1, ..., gn. Usually some orders
# will work better than others, and a possible project would be to create a
# heuristic function to choose a good order.
